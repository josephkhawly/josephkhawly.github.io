This is a replacement for the default startpage in Chrome and Firefox. Feel free to clone or fork it and adjust it to your liking by adding/removing links and changing the background, fonts and colors.

The text at the top will change depending on the time of day.

# Setup
## Chrome
- Install the [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en) extension
- Clone this repository to your desktop or click "Download ZIP" on the side and extract it.
